This is main repository for course work as part of Coursera course for [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/)

I took this course during a lag in deeplearning.ai specialization course release for Module #5 - Sequence Models.  I also wanted to take step back and understand previously cited research by Andrew Ng and his "Heroes of deep learning" series.

### Instructors
Andrew Ng, Co-founder, Coursera, Adjunct Professor, Stanford University; formerly head of Baidu AI Group / Google Brain.

### Eureka! moment
*If you plan only to audit class, one thing to focus on*
###
- Explanations on backpropagation and how it is derived sets up future courses.

### Course structure and tools
- Course is 11 weeks.  My annotated syllable[TBD](...)
- Programming exercises in Octave/MATLAB.

### Key Takeaways
- The last half is excellent with good examples of ML applications that provide excellent foundation for the follow-on course deeplearning.ai.  I especially, liked the explanation of SVMs, dimensionality reduction methods like principal component analysis (PCA) as predessors to current DL state of the art ANN architectures.

### Course work

### Related
- This is foundational course to Geoff Hinton's Neural Networks for Machine Learning as well as Andrew Ng's Deeplearning.ai specialization.

### Future Work
- Sample key exercises and port to other languages like Python, Scala for more reinforcment
- Identify key gaps between original Stanford Fall 2011
